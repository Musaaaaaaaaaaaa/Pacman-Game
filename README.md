Pac-Man Game (C++)
This project is a fully functional implementation of the classic Pac-Man game, developed in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The game replicates the traditional gameplay of Pac-Man, including player movement, ghost AI, scoring, and level progression, while also incorporating additional features for a smooth gaming experience.

Features:
Player Control: The player can control Pac-Manâ€™s movement using keyboard inputs, allowing smooth navigation through the maze while avoiding ghosts.
Ghost AI: Implemented ghost movement and behavior based on pathfinding algorithms to chase the player intelligently, simulating the behavior from the original game.
Collision Detection: Developed efficient algorithms to handle collisions between Pac-Man, walls, ghosts, and pellets, ensuring accurate interactions within the game environment.
Scoring System: Integrated a real-time scoring mechanism that tracks player progress as they consume pellets and avoid ghosts.
Multiple Levels: Added support for multiple levels with increasing difficulty, including a level progression system that advances the player through increasingly challenging mazes.
User Interface: Designed an intuitive graphical interface with real-time updates to the player's score, lives, and level progression.
Power-Ups: Implemented power-up mechanics such as the ability to temporarily consume ghosts for bonus points after collecting special items.
Technical Details:
Object-Oriented Design: Utilized key OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure the game efficiently and enable easy future scalability.
Dynamic Memory Management: Managed game objects using dynamic memory allocation, ensuring efficient use of system resources and smooth gameplay.
Pathfinding Algorithms: Employed algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) for ghost movement and intelligent chasing patterns.
Optimized Game Loop: Built an efficient game loop for handling real-time player input, game state updates, and screen rendering at smooth frame rates.
