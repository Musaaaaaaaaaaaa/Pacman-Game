This project is a fully functional implementation of the classic Pac-Man game, developed in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It replicates the traditional gameplay, where the player controls Pac-Man through a maze, avoiding ghosts while consuming pellets to earn points. The game includes core features such as player movement, ghost AI, a scoring system, and level progression, offering an engaging and smooth gaming experience.

The ghost AI is designed using pathfinding algorithms that mimic the behavior of the original Pac-Man game. Ghosts intelligently chase the player, requiring them to navigate the maze strategically. Collision detection between Pac-Man, walls, ghosts, and pellets is implemented using efficient algorithms, ensuring smooth interactions and responsiveness. Additionally, the game incorporates power-up mechanics, allowing Pac-Man to consume ghosts temporarily for bonus points after collecting special items.

This project uses an object-oriented design, leveraging key concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to ensure the game is modular and scalable. Dynamic memory management is employed to handle game objects efficiently, ensuring optimal use of system resources. The game loop is optimized to handle real-time player input, updating game states and rendering the screen at smooth frame rates.

The game also features an intuitive graphical user interface, displaying the playerâ€™s score, lives, and level progression in real-time. Multiple levels with increasing difficulty are supported, providing a progressive challenge as the player advances. Future enhancements could include a multiplayer mode, improved AI behavior using advanced algorithms, and additional levels with user-generated content.
